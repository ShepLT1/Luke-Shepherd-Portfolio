                            <p>I graduated from the University of Washington in 2017 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Psychology with the intention of later applying to a graduate program to become a prosthetics and orthotics clinician. My coursework in preparation for a prosthetics career included biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. After graduation, I was unfortunately unable to enroll in a prosthetics graduate program due to the development of back issues from the demanding physical nature of a prosthetics career. Since then, I have worked on the administrative side of the healthcare field and am currently a Patient Care Coordinator for a gastroenterology clinic at Swedish Medical Group in Ballard. While I have learned much during my time in the healthcare field, my career interests have grown outside of patient care.</p>

                            <p>I have been interested in computer programming ever since I was introduced to HTML in middle school and have recently decided to pursue it as a potential career. In my free time, I completed an online web development course through Udemy.com and am currently enrolled in the University of Washington Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. My current goal is to pursue a career in full-stack web development following the completion of my programming education.</p>
