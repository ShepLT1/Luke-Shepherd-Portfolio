# Luke-Shepherd-Portfolio

## Project Overview

For this project, I was asked to create a deployable website with bio, portfolio, and contact sections each featuring a header with navigation bar, main content, and a footer.

### Features of the Website

 * Valid semantic html

 * Responsive layout, images at 768, 640, 576, 425, 375, & 320 pixel widths to accomodate popular devices

 * Responsive dropdown menu and wrapped portfolio images when viewport width equals or drops below 640 pixels

 * Content fit to viewport width at or below 576 pixels (mobile)
 
 * Contact form includes validation atributes

 * Pseudoclasses applied to navigation bar, dropdown menu, and contact form

 * Utilizes Bootstrap's grid system

 * Dark theme for least strenuous readability
